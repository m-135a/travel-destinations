## Sources
This application was created after finishing [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy by Colt Steele. In the course, an application called YelpCamp was created, which is similar to this one. The main difference is that YelpCamp used Google maps to show the maps, while TravelDestinations uses Mapquest and Mapbox.
